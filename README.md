# Springboard-Foundations-of-Data-Science-Exercise-1
March 2017

This code is my data wrangling exercise 1 from Springboard's Foundations of Data Science course in March 2017. In this exercise, I was given a messy dataset, called 'refine', and set about tidying and manipulating it for analysis. 

The packages I used for this project were tidry, dplyr, and readxl.
